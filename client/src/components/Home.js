            This version of the guide, includes the full plant guide with (by my
            count) 640* fantasy plant and fungal species for use in adventuring
            and exploration throughout Faerun and beyond. The other major
            updates for this version are the Wizards of the Coast creative
            licensing.
          </p>
          <p>* I have a count of 639. Not sure which one I am missing.</p>
